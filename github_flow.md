1. Clone the repo https://github.com/Ricky199X/news_app_project (no need to fork, Ricky will give you write access)

2. Checkout to your own branch (you can name it your initials-feature-you're-working-on):

```
git checkout -b mc-routing

```

3. Code and do your normal add and commit

```
git add .
git commit -m 'add routing and blah blah blah'
git push origin mc-routing
```

4. Head back to https://github.com/Ricky199X/news_app_project and you should see a green button to merge and pull request -- click it, leave a msg and Ricky will handle the pull request on his end

5. Go back to the master branch

```
git checkout master
```

6. Check if master branch got updated by someone else

```
git pull origin master
```

7. Repeat from step 2
